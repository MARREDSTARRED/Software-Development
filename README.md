I'm a hard working young man. I want to learn as much as I can.
I know that things will get hard but I won't quit. I'm taking this course
to help out others. I want to build equipment for farmers and make it affordable
and open to them to work on and build it to their needs. I also make small games
on the side and work with my hands to build all manner of things physical and digital.
